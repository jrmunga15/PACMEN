# PACMEN

## Description 
This is a factory designed to make two pacmen. The starter.html code is included. When pressing "make one" button, you must complete code to position the new pacmen image and add it to the game div. This new pacmen will then be added to the array of pacmen, keeping track of the position and velocity of each one. It is also necessary to make each Pacman bounce off any wall they hit. 

## How to Run: 
In order to run, it is necessary to save the code and insert it into a new browser. You can use the two buttons to add a Pacman and start the game. The different Pacmen will bounce off the screen's borders, and they will move faster if you click on the "start game" button several times. 

## Roadmap: 
I would like to improve by adding different colors to the Pacmen every so often. This could make the program more dynamic. It would also be interesting to add an option to delete the Pacmen if the user clicks on them with the mouse.
